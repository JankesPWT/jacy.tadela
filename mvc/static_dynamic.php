Static methods are methods that are associated with a class, rather than with an instance of the class. These methods can be called without the need to create an instance of the class first.

Dynamic methods are methods that are associated with an instance of a class. They can only be called on an instance of the class.

In the context of MVC controllers, dynamic methods are often used to represent actions that can be performed on a specific resource (e.g. creating, updating, or deleting a particular record in the database), 

while static methods are often used to represent actions that don't require an instance of the class (e.g. listing all records in the database).

Static methods can also be used for utility functions or to group related methods together under a common namespace.
