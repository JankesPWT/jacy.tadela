Not the place to give a complete tutorial, but here it is in short;

RewriteCond (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/en/mod/mod_rewrite.html#RewriteCond) 
basically means "execute the next RewriteRule only if this is true". 
The !-l path is the condition that the request is not for a link 
(! means not, -l means link)

The RewriteRule (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/en/mod/mod_rewrite.html#RewriteRule)
 basically means that if the request is done 
that matches ^(.+)$ (matches any URL except the server root), 
it will be rewritten as index.php?url=$1 which means a request 
for ollewill be rewritten as index.php?url=olle).

QSA means that if there's a query string passed with the original URL, 
it will be appended to the rewrite (olle?p=1 will be rewritten 
as index.php?url=olle&p=1.

L means if the rule matches, don't process any more RewriteRules below this one.

For more complete info on this, follow the links above. 
The rewrite support can be a bit hard to grasp, 
but there are quite a few examples on stackoverflow to learn from.
